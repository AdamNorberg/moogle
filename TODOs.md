## TODOs

- More thorough unit testing
- Cute moogle logo.
- IntoIterator for &T for all builtin `.iter()`-providing Ts.
- Allow an iterator to stay alive during changes to the underlying object (by tracking the last key hit and using BTree operations)
- Allow multiple junctions to share a database and allow Prolog-like querying across that database.
